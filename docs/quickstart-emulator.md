# Quickstart: DPU Emulator

Get Secure Infrastructure running locally without hardware. Use this guide to learn the system, run CI/CD pipelines, or evaluate the product.

Starting over? See [Clean Slate](#appendix-a-clean-slate) to reset your environment.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Make
- 3 terminal windows (server, emulator, CLI commands)

## Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/secure-infra.git
cd secure-infra
make
```

## Environment Setup

Set the encryption key before running any commands:

```bash
export SECURE_INFRA_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

To persist across sessions:

```bash
echo "export SECURE_INFRA_KEY=$SECURE_INFRA_KEY" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

For testing only, you can use the `--insecure` flag instead, but this stores keys unencrypted.

---

## Step 1: Start the Server

The server tracks your DPU inventory, attestation state, and authorization policies.

```bash
bin/server --listen :8080
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"0.3.0"}
```

---

## Step 2: Create a Tenant

Every DPU and operator belongs to a tenant.

```bash
bin/bluectl tenant add gpu-prod --description "GPU Production Cluster"
# Expected: Created tenant 'gpu-prod' (id: tnt_...)
```

---

## Step 3: Start the DPU Emulator

The emulator simulates a BlueField DPU with mock attestation data.

```bash
bin/dpuemu serve --port 50051 --fixture dpuemu/fixtures/bf3-static.json
# Expected: dpuemu gRPC server listening on :50051
```

Leave this running in a separate terminal (Terminal 2).

---

## Step 4: Register the Emulated DPU

Tell the server about your emulated DPU:

```bash
bin/bluectl dpu add localhost --name bf3
# Expected: Added DPU 'bf3' at localhost:50051 (id: ...)

bin/bluectl tenant assign gpu-prod bf3
# Expected: Assigned DPU 'bf3' to tenant 'gpu-prod'
```

---

## Step 5: Create an Operator

Admins manage infrastructure. Operators push credentials. This separation creates an audit trail.

### 5a: Create invitation (as admin)

```bash
bin/bluectl operator invite operator@example.com gpu-prod
# Expected: Code: GPU-XXXX-XXXX
```

Save the invite code from the output.

### 5b: Accept invitation (as operator)

```bash
bin/km init
# Enter the invite code when prompted
# Expected: Bound successfully.
```

Verify:

```bash
bin/km whoami
# Expected: Operator: operator@example.com
```

---

## Step 6: Create SSH CA and Grant Access

### 6a: Create CA (as operator)

An SSH CA signs short-lived certificates instead of scattering static keys across servers.

```bash
bin/km ssh-ca create test-ca
# Expected: SSH CA 'test-ca' created.
```

### 6b: Grant access (as admin)

```bash
bin/bluectl operator grant operator@example.com gpu-prod test-ca bf3
# Expected: Authorization granted
```

---

## Step 7: Submit Attestation

The DPU must prove it's running trusted firmware before receiving credentials. The emulator provides mock attestation.

```bash
bin/bluectl attestation bf3
# Expected: Attestation Status: ATTESTATION_STATUS_VALID
```

---

## Step 8: Distribute Credentials

Push the CA to the emulated DPU:

```bash
bin/km push ssh-ca test-ca bf3
# Expected: CA installed at /etc/ssh/trusted-user-ca-keys.d/test-ca.pub
```

With the emulator, credentials are stored locally. On real hardware, they'd be pushed to the host via the DPU.

---

## Step 9: Test Host Agent (Optional)

The host agent collects security posture and receives credentials. With the emulator, it connects via HTTP.

```bash
bin/host-agent --dpu-agent http://localhost:9443 --oneshot
```

---

## What's Next?

You've completed the emulator quickstart. The emulator can't simulate:

- Trust relationships between hosts (requires real host-agents paired with DPUs)
- Hardware-secured credential delivery via tmfifo
- Real attestation from TPM/DICE

When you're ready for production, see [Hardware Setup Guide](setup-hardware.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `encryption key not configured` | SECURE_INFRA_KEY not set | Re-run `export SECURE_INFRA_KEY=...` |
| `address already in use` | Port 8080 or 50051 busy | Kill existing process or use different port |
| `UNIQUE constraint failed` | Stale data from previous run | See [Clean Slate](#appendix-a-clean-slate) |
| `not authorized to access CA` | Grant not applied | Re-run `bluectl operator grant ...` |
| `connection refused` | Server or emulator not running | Check Terminals 1 and 2 |

## Appendix A: Clean Slate

To reset and start fresh, remove the database:

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/share/bluectl/dpus.db
```

## Appendix B: Shell Completion

```bash
# Zsh
echo 'source <(bin/bluectl completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'source <(bin/km completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Bash
echo 'source <(bin/bluectl completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source <(bin/km completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
