#                          node configuration file.  Only necessary to configure if the bind IP
#                          is present on multiple network interfaces.

#  Possible Values:
#      0:  Disable encryption and authentication
#      1:  Enable encryption and authentication
#  Default value: 0
ENABLE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION=0

#  Description:  This determines how fabric manager will try to retrieve the keys, certificates, and certificate
#                authority for authentication and encryption.
#                If ENABLE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION is enabled (1), then AUTH_SOURCE must be configured
#                as one of the supported values.  An empty or unexpected value will prevent initialization.

#  Possible Values:
#      FILE:      The provided values are paths to files on the file system.
#      ENV_PATH:  The provided values are environment variable names to retrieve, and the values in the
#                 environment variables are treated as paths to files on the file system.
#      ENV_VAL:   The provided values are environment variable names to retrieve, and the values in the
#                 environment variables are treated as the actual values for the key/cert/cert auth.
AUTH_SOURCE=

# Description:  These fields are interpreted based on how AUTH_SOURCE is configured
SERVER_KEY=
SERVER_CERT=
SERVER_CERT_AUTH=
CLIENT_KEY=
CLIENT_CERT=
CLIENT_CERT_AUTH=

#  Description:  Override the target hostname for authentication of the certificates and keys.  This allows
#                certificates with common names that do not match the ip addresses provided for the nodes.
#                Example:
#                  If the certificate has the subject:
#                    "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=NVIDIA/OU=Test/CN=localhost"
#                  The certificate validation will expect the connection hostname to be "localhost", by
#                  setting IMEX_SECURITY_TARGET_OVERRIDE=localhost you can cause override the connection
#                  hostname for security purposes to be "localhost", allowing the connection to succeed.
#                If USE_RPC is 0, this is ignored.
SECURITY_TARGET_OVERRIDE=

#  Description: This tunable determines the domain behavior in case the trunk links are down or experience
#               fatal errors. When MNNVL_RESILIENCY_MODE is set to 0, in case a single trunk link fails, the
#               inter-node traffic between the impacted L1 switch node and the rest of the domain will be
#               unavailable. When MNNVL_RESILIENCY_MODE is set to 1, the domain can sustain up to failures
#               of half (excluded) of the trunk links on an L1 switch before the inter-node traffic between
#               this L1 switch node and the rest of the domain becomes unavailable.
MNNVL_RESILIENCY_MODE=0

#	Description: Determine whether a default partition needs to be created
#	Possible Values:
#       0             - No partitions are created during GFM initialization. GFM disables routing until an API request 
#                     to create a partition is successful.
#       1(default)    - Creates a default partition during GFM initialization. GFM creates the partition to include
#                     all GPUs in the topology and enables routing so that all GPUs can communicate to each other.
    
MNNVL_ENABLE_DEFAULT_PARTITION=1

  SYS  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the SMP interconnect between NUMA nodes (e.g., QPI/UPI)
  NODE = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the interconnect between PCIe Host Bridges within a NUMA node
  PHB  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as a PCIe Host Bridge (typically the CPU)
  PXB  = Connection traversing multiple PCIe bridges (without traversing the PCIe Host Bridge)
  PIX  = Connection traversing at most a single PCIe bridge
