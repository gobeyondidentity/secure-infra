# Secure Infrastructure

**v0.6.8** | [Demo](scripts/demo) | [Quickstart](docs/guides/quickstart-emulator.md) | [Hardware Setup](docs/guides/setup-hardware.md) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Automated credential lifecycle for AI infrastructure. No manual rotation. No secret sprawl. Credentials refresh automatically when you reimage nodes.

## Overview

Secure Infrastructure eliminates credential management overhead in GPU clusters. Push credentials once; the system handles distribution, rotation, and cleanup automatically. When you reimage a node, fresh credentials appear without tickets or manual intervention.

This works because credentials are tied to specific hardware via NVIDIA BlueField DPUs. They can't accidentally spread to other machines, so reimaging a node doesn't require hunting down credentials elsewhere. The DPU verifies host health before any credential operation, giving you automated distribution at scale.

## Features

- **Automation-ready**: Structured output (`-o json`), idempotent commands, meaningful exit codes for CI/CD
- **Zero secret sprawl**: Credentials die with the node; fresh ones created automatically on reimage
- **No network configuration**: DOCA ComCh transport uses native PCIe between host and DPU
- **SSH CA management**: Create, sign, push certificate authorities across your fleet
- **Full audit trail**: Every credential push logged with timestamp and operator identity
- **No credential drift**: Keys tied to specific hardware, can't accidentally spread to other machines
- **Health-gated operations**: Distribution proceeds only when hosts pass automatic health checks

## Quick Start

> **See it in action:** Run `./scripts/demo` to watch the full credential lifecycle in 2 minutes.

Choose your path:

| Path | Time | Requirements |
|------|------|--------------|
| [Emulator Quickstart](docs/guides/quickstart-emulator.md) | 10 min | Go 1.22+, Make |
| [Hardware Setup](docs/guides/setup-hardware.md) | 30 min | BlueField-3 DPU |

**Try the emulator first** to learn the system without hardware. The quickstart walks you through the full flow: create a tenant, register a DPU, set up operators, and push credentials automatically.

Credentials flow to verified infrastructure without manual intervention. If a node fails health checks, distribution pauses until it's healthy again.

## Installation

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install nmelo/tap/bluectl nmelo/tap/km                    # CLI tools
brew install nmelo/tap/sentry nmelo/tap/nexus nmelo/tap/dpuemu # Agents and emulator
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
# Add repository (auto-detects your distro)
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/beyond-identity/secure-infra/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bluectl km
```

### Linux (RHEL/Fedora)

```bash
# Add repository (auto-detects your distro)
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/beyond-identity/secure-infra/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | sudo bash
sudo yum install bluectl km
```

### Docker

```bash
